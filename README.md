# Simple HTTPS Server

This project implements a basic HTTPS server using C and OpenSSL. It demonstrates how to set up a secure server that responds to HTTPS requests.

## Features

- HTTPS support using OpenSSL
- Simple HTTP response
- Listens on port 443 (standard HTTPS port)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a Linux/Unix system
- You have installed OpenSSL development libraries
- You have a valid SSL certificate and private key

## Building the project

To build this project, follow these steps:

A basic HTTPS server implemented in C using OpenSSL. This project demonstrates how to set up a secure server that responds to HTTPS requests.

## Features

- HTTPS support using OpenSSL
- Simple HTTP response
- Listens on port 443 (standard HTTPS port)

## Prerequisites

- Linux/Unix system
- OpenSSL development libraries
- Valid SSL certificate and private key

## Building and Running

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-https-server.git
cd simple-https-server

2. Compile the code:
gcc -o https_server main.c -lssl -lcrypto


3. Ensure your SSL certificate (`server.crt`) and private key (`server.key`) are in the same directory as the executable.

4. Run the server (may require root privileges):
sudo ./https_server


5. Connect to the server using a web browser:https://your-server-ip/


This code sets up a basic HTTPS server that:

Initializes OpenSSL
Creates an SSL context and loads the certificate and key
Sets up a socket to listen for connections
Accepts client connections and performs SSL handshakes
Responds with a simple HTML message

Security Considerations
This is a basic example for educational purposes. For production use, consider:

Implementing proper error handling and logging
Using up-to-date SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers
Regularly updating SSL certificates
Implementing additional security measures (input validation, rate limiting, etc.)
